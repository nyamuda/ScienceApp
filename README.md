# Overview

This educational API is designed to assist high school physics students in learning how to define physics terms with specific keywords. The primary focus is on improving students' understanding of the required definitions for various physics concepts. 
The current version of the application includes a model for "Curriculum," allowing users to create, read, update, and delete curriculums.

The purpose of developing this software is to create a tool that supports physics students in mastering the art of defining terms accurately, which is crucial for academic success. 
As a software engineer, the goal is to leverage C# to build a functional and user-friendly application that enhances the learning experience for high school students studying physics.
